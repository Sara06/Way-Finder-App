            <p>The library provides access to printers that students can use to print, <br>
            photocopy and scan documents. <br>
            Prices are displayed behind the multi function devices (MFDs). <br>
            Payments can be made at the service desk via card, at Client Services,<br>
            or by yourself from the North Metropolitan TAFE Library website.<br>
            (Maybe include a note about payments being a $2.00 minimum).</p>
